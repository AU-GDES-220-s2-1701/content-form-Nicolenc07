					<h1>About the Creator</h1>

					<p> Game designer Will Wright was inspired to create a "virtual doll house" after losing his home during the Oakland firestorm of 1991 and subsequently rebuilding his life. Replacing his home and his other possessions made him think about adapting that life experience into a game. When he initially took his ideas to the Maxis board of the directors, they were skeptical and gave little support or financing for the game. The directors at Electronic Arts, which bought Maxis in	1997, were more receptiveâ€”SimCity had been a great success for them, and they foresaw the possibility of building a strong Sim franchise.
					</p>
					<p> Will Wright has also stated that The Sims was actually meant as a satire of U.S. consumer culture. Wright also took ideas from the 1977 architecture and urban design book A Pattern Language, American psychologist Abraham Maslow's 1943 paper A Theory of Human Motivation and his hierarchy of needs, and Charles Hampden-Turner's Maps of the Mind to develop a model for the game's artificial intelligence.</p>
