					<h1>The Sims 4: Expansion Packs</h1>
						<h3>Get to Work</h3>
							<p>The first expansion pack adds three new playable, active careers: Doctor, Detective and Scientist. Get to Work also gives the opportunity to build your own retail store and start your own retail business. The expansion pack also adds a new neighborhood called Magnolia Promenade, and planet Sixam, an alien home world, as well as playable alien Sims. It also adds two new skills (Baking and Photography), new objects and clothing.</p>
						<h3>Get Together</h3>
							<p>The second expansion pack was announced on August 5, 2015 at Gamescom. Get Together adds many features that Sims can do with their friends, such as clubs, DJ booth, dancing and DJ skills, and natural pools. The expansion pack also adds a new neighborhood called Windenburg.</p>
						<h3>City Living</h3>
							<p>The third expansion pack features a new city called San Myshuno with four unique neighborhoods. City Living introduces new careers reflective of our time including the returning politician career and two new brand new fields never seen in the franchise: social media and critic. The expansion pack focuses on city life and reintroduces apartments into the city, ranging from fixer-uppers to penthouses. There are many new lots and activities for Sims to explore such the Spice Market, Karaoke Bar, Geek Con with video game competitions, the Spice Festival with curry eating contests and a Romance Festival for love-seeking Sims. Apartments will feature lot traits which can be assigned to any lot. The new lot traits will also be available to players who do not purchase the expansion via patch.</p>
