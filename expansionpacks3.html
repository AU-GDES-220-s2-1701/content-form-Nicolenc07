					<h1>The Sims 3: Expansion Packs</h1>
					<h3>World Adventures</h3>
						<p>The Sims 3: World Adventures or World Adventures is the first expansion pack for the strategic life simulation computer game The Sims 3. It was announced on The Sims 3 website in August 2009, and had a North American release on November 18, 2009.</p>
						<p>The expansion pack focuses on travelling to various areas in a manner similar to previous expansions The Sims: Vacation and The Sims 2: Bon Voyage. Sims are able to travel to simplified versions of France, China, and Egypt. At these locations, sims are able to participate in adventures to earn rewards and benefits. Sims are also able to level up in new skills: photography, martial arts, and nectar making. In addition, the expansion pack provides new objects, socials, wishes, and opportunities.</p>
						<p>Early reception of the expansion pack has been positive with the expansion pack earning a Metacritic rating of 81.</p>
					<h3>Ambitions</h3>
						<p>The Sims 3: Ambitions is the second expansion pack for the strategic life simulation computer game The Sims 3. It was released in June 2010. The Sims 3: Ambitions introduces new career opportunities and control mechanisms into gameplay. Manipulation of Sims' career progressions, actions and interactions during their working are feasible. Additional career pathways introduce a diversity of skill sets available for acquisition. These features, which were absent in The Sims 3, give players greater control of their Sims' career pathways, choices and lives.</p>
					<h3>Late Night</h3>
						<p>The Sims 3: Late Night (LN) is the third expansion pack for the strategic life simulation computer game The Sims 3 and is similar to previous expansions The Sims 2: Nightlife for The Sims 2 and The Sims: Hot Date for The Sims. It incorporates some elements from The Sims: House Party, The Sims: Superstar, and The Urbz: Sims in the City.</p>
						<p>This expansion pack also introduces a brand new city neighborhood named 'Bridgeport', based on the cities of San Francisco and Los Angeles, which is divided into an urban/downtown area, a less dense uptown area, and a hilly, affluent suburb.</p>
					<h3>Generations</h3>
						<p>The Sims 3: Generations (GEN) is the fourth expansion pack for The Sims 3, which EA announced by press release and video trailer on April 5, 2011. The game was released on May 31, 2011. It contains elements of The Sims 2: Family Fun Stuff, The Sims: House Party, The Sims 2: Teen Style Stuff, The Sims 2: FreeTime, The Sims 2: University, and The Sims 2: Celebration! Stuff. It is the first major expansion pack that does not contain a game manual, instead containing a simple install guide with the serial code attached. All packs from this point on do not contain a manual.</p>
					<h3>Pets</h3>
						<p>The Sims 3: Pets is the fifth expansion pack for The Sims 3 on PC and Mac, and is the second console game in the series. It was released on October 18, 2011 in North America. Like in previous expansions for The Sims games, this expansion introduces pets such as cats and dogs and, for the first time, horses into the game.</p>
					<h3>Showtime</h3>
						<p>The Sims 3: Showtime is the sixth expansion pack for The Sims 3 on OS X and Windows. It was released on March 2012. A limited collector's edition includes exclusive in-game content such as a stage and two costumes along with a poster based on American singer Katy Perry.</p>
					<h3>Supernatural</h3>
						<p>Players can create supernatural (non human) sims such as witches, wizards, werewolves, zombies, vampires (updated), ghosts (in which they may choose how the sim "died"), fairies, and if showtime is installed, Genies. Each have their own magical abilities, traits, and interactions. Supernatural comes with a new world called Moonlight Falls. Sims can learn the new alchemy skill which teaches sims how to brew different potions and elixirs with certain ingredients. Sims also learn new spells which can be used to either charm or hex other sims. New objects include a broomstick, a gypsy caravan, a magic mirror, and a sliding bookcase door. Most of the objects have a gothic theme. Bonehilda, a skeleton non-player character, returns from The Sims: Makin' Magic. Sims can also turn into zombies using a 'zombification potion'. The six new traits included are Supernatural Skeptic, Supernatural Fan, Night Owl, Brooding, Gatherer and Proper.</p>
					<h3>Seasons</h3>
						<p>Players can interact with weather, get into the mood of each season and tell meaningful stories with their sims. There are also unique festivals during each season, with events sims can take part in. Sims can get their faces painted and compete in a hot dog eating contest in the summer, carve a pumpkin and bob for apples during fall and have snowball fight or go snowboarding and ice skating in the winter. Sims can also swim in the ocean and play soccer all year round. There are new traits, "loves the cold" and "loves the heat". Sims with these traits will enjoy extreme temperatures, finding the cold or heat pleasant rather than uncomfortable. Sims can also catch a cold, get a tan, or get struck by lightning. Days are shorter in winter and longer in summer. The creature in this expansion pack is aliens, similar to the ones from The Sims 2 but with some updates.</p>
						<p>There is a new feature that will allow players to change the appearance of lots throughout the year called "Seasonal Lot Marker". Players can set up different objects and decorations for every season, but cannot make build mode changes like walls or roofing. It is the key to the shifting seasonal festivals, but it also functions on community and residential lots.</p>
						<p>Seasons adds new clothings like snowgear, swimwear, and raincoats. It adds filters in Create a Sim, which allow the player to find clothing from a certain expansion or stuff pack. Clothing from the base game, expansions, stuff packs, and the store will be updated to be selectable as outerwear.</p>
					<h3>University Life</h3>
						<p>Sims University is a sub-neighborhood probably based on New England Campuses that functions similarly to the vacation worlds in World Adventures. Its mascot is a llama. In order to attend university, Sims must be a young adult, adult or elder. When a non-player mascot is near the Sims' lots, they can take an aptitude test. The results will depend on their skills, traits, work experience and school grades. The results also show the total aptitude score, along with the sub-scores for the majors and cerid award. The amount of financial assistance (scholarship) provided to the Sim is also determined by the test. Teen can also take the aptitude test, to see what skills they need to work on but they can not go to University before they grow up to be a young adult.</p>
						<p>Enrolling in college can be done on phone, computer, or going to the public school and enrolling there. The player can select the Sim's major, out of either Business, Communications, Fine Arts, Physical Education, Science and Medicine, or Technology, as well as the amount of credits they wish to study for, and whether they want to study for one or two terms. Taking more credits will allow a Sim to obtain their degree faster, but they will have more of their time taken up by studying.</p>
						<p>To receive a degree, a Sim must obtain 48 credits for it, and pass their final exams. Having a degree will allow a Sim to start at a higher level in careers relevant to the degree, and they will also be paid more. These benefits will increase the higher the Sim's grade.</p>
						<p>University Life also introduces social groups: Jocks, Nerds and Rebels. The player can join these social groups, and move up in their rankings by befriending members of the group and/or doing activities and interactions related to the group. As they progress through the ranks they can unlock new interactions and objects, and later pick an additional trait. A Sim who reaches rank 10 with a group will be given a job offer in a special career unique to that group.</p>
					<h3>Island Paradise</h3>
						<p>Island Paradise is a vacation and adventure-themed expansion, similar to The Sims: Vacation, The Sims 2: Bon Voyage, and The Sims 3: World Adventures. It was created by EA Maxis (Redwood Shores) and published by Electronic Arts.</p>
						<p>One of the key new features is the option for Sims to own houseboats. These can be docked at any unoccupied port, or anchored anywhere in the ocean, and the player can have a Sim drive the boat wherever they want, as well as retain control of the other Sims in the household as the boat moves. Houseboats function the same way as other lots: The player can build on them as they see fit and services (newspaper delivery, mail, etc.) will use speedboats and jetskis to access them.</p>
						<p>The expansion pack also introduces the Scuba diving skill, which will allow Sims to dive underwater at certain points on the map, for a few in-game hours at a time. Whilst diving, Sims can catch fish, explore underwater caves, find sunken treasure, as well as use a limited set of social interactions. Sharks will occasionally appear during a dive, and may attack, and even kill Sims. Sims can also drown if they stay underwater for too long and use up their oxygen supply, although a new lifetime reward allows them to breathe indefinitely. After a Sim returns to the surface, they will have to decompress for a short amount of time before diving again.</p>
						<p>Island Paradise introduces the Lifeguard career (though if the player has Ambitions, Sims can register as self-employed divers). Lifeguards are dispatched to a random beach during their work hours, and will have to survey the ocean, rescue Sims who are drowning, and perform CPR demonstrations.</p>
						<p>Sims can now own and manage resorts, that will provide a daily cash income based on the net profit they make. The player can increase the amount of money they get by increasing the guest capacity, as well as providing amenities (fitness equipment, swimming pools, buffet tables, etc.) for guests, in order to increase the resort's rating and allow the hotel to charge higher prices. The player can also manage resort staff, hiring workers and choosing their uniforms.</p>
						<p>Mermaids are the new life state introduced in Island Paradise. Sims can encounter them while diving, and later summon them onto land. Mermaid Sims can breathe underwater, are immune to decompression, and all young adult mermaids have a maximum diving skill. If a mermaid spends too much time out of the ocean however, they will become a normal Sim.</p>
					<h3>Into the Future</h3>
						<p>The expansion is futuristic themed. Upon installation, players may be visited by a time traveller in their home neighborhood, who gives their sims his time portal for use upon receiving help from the player. Using this portal, sims can travel to the future, into a new sub-neighborhood called "Oasis Landing", a futuristic town built amongst mountainous wastelands.</p>
						<p>Plumbots (similar to simbots and servos in previous sim games) are a major addition to the expansion. They can be built and fully customized with the new "Create-A-Bot" mode, and players can create various trait chips that determines their personality, use and gameplay. Hoverboards, jetpacks, monorails and hovercars are introduced to the game as new transportation options. New careers include astronomers and bot dealers. New objects include holographic TVs, food synthesizers, build-a-bot workshops and the laser rythimacon, a new instrument.</p>
						<p>Sims are also able to visit their future descendants during time travel, and can change or eliminate these descendants altogether if the player sends the sim back to the present and changes their lifestyle or fate.</p>
