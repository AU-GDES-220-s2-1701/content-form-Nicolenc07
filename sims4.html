					<h1>The Sims 4: Gameplay</h1>
					<p>The Sims 4 is a life simulation game, similar to its predecessors. Players create a Sim character and control their life to explore different personalities which change the way the game plays out. Sims can multitask such as talk while doing a task. Sims' moodlets also change the gameplay. For example, a Sim can do a task while being either angry or totally excited.</p>
					<p>Similar to previous Sims games, player-created challenges abound. One of the most prevalent is the Legacy Challenge, in which players create a single Sim and try to make its family line last for ten generations.</p>

					<h3>Create a Sim</h3>
					<p>One major change to the Sims 4 Create A Sim is that sliders have been replaced by direct mouse click, drag and pull. Through mouse click, drag and pull players may directly manipulate the facial features of a Sim. Players can also directly manipulate any body part including the abdomen, chest, legs, arms and feet. This is a new feature and was not included in previous Sims games where only the fitness and fatness can be manipulated on a Sims body. However, fitness and fatness levels may still be adjusted in Sims 4 with sliders as in previous games.The base games comes with over 40 hairstyles for both men and women. There are up to 18 hair colour options per hairstyle.</p>
					<p>Selections of premade designs of Sims are available to choose from, ranging from different body shapes to ethnicities.</p>
					<p>Seven life stages are available including baby, toddler, child, teenager, young adult, adult and elder. Although the baby life stage is accessible only through the birth of a Sim and not available in Create A Sim. Toddlers were initially absent from the original game release, but were added in the January 2017 patch.</p>
					<p>Traits have returned with each Sim having three traits and an aspiration containing its own hidden trait.</p>
					<p>Compared to previous Sims games where everyday, formal, sleepwear, athletic, party and swimwear wardrobes were restricted to having their own clothing options, all clothing options are now available across all forms of wardrobe and players are allowed up to 5 outfits per category. There is also a filter panel where clothing options can be sorted by color, material, outfit category, fashion choice, style, content and packs.</p>
					<p>In a Summer 2016 update, a big step was taken and gender options were expanded in the game, allowing any gender expression. Now all the haircuts and outfits can be worn by any Sim of any gender, and pregnancy can become a possibility regardless of the gender.</p>

					<h3>Build/Buy Modes</h3>
					<p>In The Sims 4, build and buy modes have been combined and is now treated as a single feature.</p>
					<p>A detailed build-and-buy system is present along with neighborhoods and landscaping. Some locked buy mode items may be unlocked through the progression of career levels.</p>
					<p>Entire buildings and rooms can now be moved across the lot. Wall heights can also now be adjusted.</p>
					<p>There is also a pool tool feature, with a custom version and triangular, square and octagonal pool tools too.</p>
					<p>There are build mode cheats such as "motherlode", which enables the player to automatically gain ยง50,000 (simoleons) to buy things with.</p>
					<p>There is now a search option to search for build and buy mode options. When building a house for your sim you can buy already made rooms which can help but costs a lot of money depending on the style of the room.</p>

				<h3>The Gallery</h3>
					<p>The Sims 4 includes social features, such as importing Sims and houses other people have made from The Gallery into the player's game. This impacts the world around the player's Sims. Players may publish their creations into the Gallery for other players to download into their game instantly.</p>
					<p>On January 9, 2015, EA released a version of The Gallery for iOS and Android devices.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="sims4gameswords5">
				<h3>Worlds</h3>
					<p>The Sims 4 base game originally shipped with two worlds; Willow Creek and Oasis Springs. Both worlds contain five neighborhoods and a total of 21 lots. Newcrest became available with a free update, having three neighborhoods with five empty lots in each, for a total of 15 lots. Magnolia Promenade came with the Get to Work expansion pack. Windenburg was introduced in The Sims 4: Get Together expansion pack. The City Living expansion pack, released in November 2016, introduced the new bustling city of San Myshuno.
